\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problems with existing approach}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Require considerable amount of effort and time for manual
    calibration
    \item Highly costly to acquire training data
    \item Trade-off between detection accuracy and detection latency
    \item Require expensive sensors such as sonar and stereo camera to
      achieve robust tracking
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Robustness
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Under varying illumination
            \item Under effect of shadow
            \item Under different degree of water perturbation 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Flexibility
    \item Automatic
\end{enumerate}
